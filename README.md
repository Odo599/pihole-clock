# Alarm Clock
## What is it?
My project is a simple alarm clock using a 128x64 OLED display. It has 7 buttons and you shall be able to set 2 different alarms.

## Why I made it?
I made this project since I don't particularly like my own alarm clock since it can only set a single alarm. This one will be able to set 2 and maybe in a new version I could add even more.

## How to use it?
1. Install Raspberry Pi OS Lite on the Pi.
2. Clone the repo.
3. Put together all the pieces.
4. Run the code over ssh from a computer (this won't always be like this, just for debugging).
5. The time is updated automatically over wifi so you don't need to set that.
6. Set alarms by holding the corresponding alarm button and then pressing the hour and minute buttons to change it.
7. Enable and disable alarms by pressing the corresponding alarm button.
